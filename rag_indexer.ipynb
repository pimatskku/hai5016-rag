Reward hacking exists because RL environments are often imperfect, and it is fundamentally challenging to accurately specify a reward function.\n",

Instances where the model learns to modify unit tests to pass coding tasks, or where responses contain biases that mimic a user’s preference, are pretty concerning and are likely one of the major blockers for real-world deployment of more autonomous use cases of AI models.\n",

This post aims to review recent developments in how to effectively use test-time compute (i.e. “thinking time”) and why it helps.\\nMotivation#\\nEnabling models to think for longer can be motivated in a few different ways.\\nAnalogy to Psychology#\\nThe core idea is deeply connected to how humans think. We humans cannot immediately provide the answer for \"What\\'s 12345 times 56789?\". Rather, it is natural to spend time pondering and analyzing before getting to the result, especially for complex problems.

By consciously slowing down and taking more time to reflect, improve and analyze, we can engage in System 2 thinking to challenge our instincts and make more rational choices.\\nComputation as a Resource#\\nOne view of deep learning, is that neural networks can be characterized by the amount of computation and storage they can access in a forward pass, and if we optimize them to solve problems using gradient descent, the optimization process will figure out how to use these resources–they’ll figure out how to organize these resources into circuits for calculation and information storage. From this view, if we design an architecture or system that can do more computation at test time, and we train it to effectively use this resource, it’ll work better.'),\n",

In fact, CoT has a nice property that it allows the model to use a variable amount of compute depending on the hardness of the problem.\\nLatent Variable Modeling#'),\n",

For example, we can model the distribution over math problems and solutions by letting $x$ denote a problem statement, $y$ be ground truth answer or proof, and $z$ as a free-form thought process that leads to the proof.
